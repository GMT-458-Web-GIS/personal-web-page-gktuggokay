        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Göktuğ, I am a Geomatic engineer.</p>
        <p>On this web page, I will give information about myself, the software I use related to my profession and the projects I work on.</p>
        <p>Working in the classical cartography field of my profession, I took part in large-scale projects such as mining, dams, construction, and land consolidation in different cities of Turkey. Although these projects had different objectives, they had a common infrastructure in terms of the measurement techniques applied and the processes requiring precision. Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data obtained from the field was the most critical and meticulous part of the job. These processes helped me to deepen my experience and expertise as well as my technical skills day by day.</p>
        <p>While taking part in different projects, I had the opportunity to observe how intertwined my profession is with other engineering disciplines and sectors. These collaborations showed me how effective cartography is in a wide range of fields. The challenges I have faced and the experiences I have gained throughout my working life have broadened my professional perspective and guided me to develop more innovative approaches in future projects. In the light of these experiences, I started to make more informed plans for both my professional development and the future of the sector.</p>
